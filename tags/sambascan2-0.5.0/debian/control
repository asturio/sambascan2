Description: Scans networks for windows/SMB/samba shares
 sambascan2 is a simple script to scan windows shares in SMB networks. It's
 main goal is to index all public files in a windows network. The indexed files
 can then be searched. Sambascan2 can also search for files in protected
 shares, if you save the account information in a configuration file. All
 options are used from the command line.
