=============================
Q: Sambascan2 doesn't seem to scan through directories. Why that? It's a Bug?
A: You are probably trying to scan in a private share. sambascan2 was only
    written to scan in public shares and not in private ones (this may change
    with the time). Another issue is that it is possible, that the Share have a
    directory with other permissions than the one neede to access it. Check the
    permission of the wanted directory, and if Samba can access it as the
    public user.

Edited (2007-05-17): With version 0.4.0 you can add login information to
sambascan2. It is not a very elegant way of scanning password protected shares,
but it is one way. Note that the password will be save as plaintext and that
anyone logged in your computer could discover that password at runtime using: 

ps -ef | grep smbclient

At the moment I don't know how to solve this "ps -ef" issue. Don't exitate in
telling me a away to avoid this :-).
